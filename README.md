# Geo-Pulse

## Overview
GeoPulse is a theoretical offensive Python module designed for precision geolocation through multi-vector correlation. Drawing inspiration from the "God's Eye" system in *Fast and Furious*, it aims to pinpoint anyone’s location or enable advanced tracking by leveraging modern signal and machine learning techniques. This project is intended for educational purposes or ethical security research under strictly controlled, authorized conditions.

**Warning**: Unauthorized use of this tool for malicious purposes is illegal under laws like the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.

## Features
- **5G Signal Spoofing**: Manipulates 5G signals to extract or infer location data.  
- **Satellite Metadata Hijack**: Captures geolocation metadata from satellite communications.  
- **ML-Based Movement Prediction**: Uses machine learning to forecast target movements based on historical data.  

## Use Cases
- **God’s Eye Context**: Pinpoints individuals with high accuracy for surveillance.  
- **General Context**: Facilitates advanced tracking for research into geolocation techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- RTL-SDR hardware (for 5G signal spoofing; not included)  
- Tor service (for anonymity)  

## Dependencies
| Library               | Purpose                     | Installation                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `rtlsdr`              | SDR signal manipulation     | `pip install pyrtlsdr`       |
| `numpy`               | Numerical processing        | `pip install numpy`          |
| `scikit-learn`        | ML movement prediction      | `pip install scikit-learn`   |
| `pysocks`             | Tor proxy support           | `pip install pysocks`        |

Built-in import used: None explicitly required beyond standard library.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Code-Mornarch/Geo-Pulse.git
   cd Geo-Pulse
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Tor for anonymity:
   - Linux/Mac: `tor`  
   - Windows: Tor Browser or proxy service  
   - Default proxy: `localhost:9050`
4. Configure RTL-SDR hardware:
   - Connect an RTL-SDR dongle (e.g., RTL2832U).  
   - Ensure drivers are installed (platform-specific).

## Usage
GeoPulse is a module, not a standalone script. Below is a speculative example of how it might be used (non-functional, as I can’t execute code):

```python
import rtlsdr
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import socks
import socket

# Configure Tor for anonymity
socks.set_default_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, "localhost", 9050)
socket.socket = socks.socksocket

# Initialize SDR
sdr = rtlsdr.RtlSdr()
sdr.sample_rate = 2.4e6  # 2.4 MHz
sdr.center_freq = 3.5e9  # 3.5 GHz (5G band)

# Load ML model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(np.random.rand(100, 3), np.random.rand(100))  # Placeholder training

def capture_signal():
    samples = sdr.read_samples(256*1024)
    return np.abs(samples)  # Simplified signal strength

def geopulse_track():
    # Capture 5G signal
    signal_data = capture_signal()
    
    # Simulate satellite metadata (placeholder)
    sat_metadata = {"lat": 34.0522, "lon": -118.2437, "timestamp": 1677654321}
    
    # ML prediction
    features = np.array([[signal_data.mean(), sat_metadata["lat"], sat_metadata["lon"]]])
    predicted_move = model.predict(features)
    print(f"Predicted next position: {predicted_move}")
    
    return {"lat": sat_metadata["lat"] + predicted_move[0], "lon": sat_metadata["lon"] + predicted_move[0]}

# Example usage
location = geopulse_track()
print(f"Tracked location: {location}")
sdr.close()
```

- **Steps**:  
  1. Import the module into your project.  
  2. Configure SDR hardware and Tor proxy.  
  3. Run to simulate signal-based geolocation and prediction.

## Technical Details
- **Signal Spoofing**: `rtlsdr` interfaces with SDR hardware to capture or manipulate 5G signals.  
- **ML Prediction**: `scikit-learn`’s `RandomForestRegressor` forecasts movement (requires pre-trained data).  
- **Anonymity**: `pysocks` routes traffic through Tor to mask the user’s origin.  
- **Numerical Processing**: `numpy` handles signal data efficiently.

## Limitations
- Requires RTL-SDR hardware and real 5G signals for practical use (not simulated here).  
- Satellite metadata hijack is a placeholder—real implementation needs satcom access.  
- ML model is untrained; effectiveness depends on quality data and features.  
- Tor introduces latency, potentially affecting real-time tracking.
